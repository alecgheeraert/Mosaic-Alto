# MosaicAlto

## What is the MosaicAlto project?
**MosaicAlto is a Septentrio Open-Source hardware project powered by the Mosaic GNSS receiver that is compatible with the Arduino Pro Portenta boards.**
The objective of this project was to allow reliable industrial use and development with the Mosaic by having the board as a carrier for the Portenta boards.

The board also has the option to be used as a standalone device by using the USB-C connector and MosaicBus has been designed to be use either the Septentrio [**Mosaic-x5**](https://www.septentrio.com/en/products/gps/gnss-receiver-modules/mosaic-x5) or the [**Mosaic-H**](https://www.septentrio.com/en/products/gps/gnss-receiver-modules/mosaic-h).


## What is the Mosaic module?
**[Mosaic modules](https://www.septentrio.com/en/products/gnss-receivers/rover-base-receivers/receivers-modules) are Septentrio's small-size and low-power GNSS receiver modules ideal for providing highly accurate positions.** Mosaic modules integrate the latest generation of GNSS technology, delivering highly accurate positions with minimal power consumption. While compact in size they fully retain the high-reliability and exceptional accuracy performance that Septentrio receivers are known for. True multi-frequency multi-constellation technology gives our module receivers access to every possible signal from all available GNSS satellite constellations including the U.S. GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, as well BeiDou, QZSS and NavIC. [Septentrioâ€™s advanced field-proven algorithms](https://www.septentrio.com/en/company/septentrio-gnss-technology) exploit this signal diversity to deliver maximum positioning availability and reference network compatibility.
